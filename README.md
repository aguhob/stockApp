Calculator Project by Minda Aguhob
Stock recommendation buy/sell

My calculator project for today is a stock recommendation web site. People who follow the stock market often don't have a disciplined structure on judging stocks to buy or sell.
This calculator gives one technical framework to try, and educates user on Elliot Wave Theory. It will help people understand how technical analysis works.
Perhaps they will get excited to look at other technical frameworks to examine wave not only in the stock market, but other phenomena that consist of waves (one's income, for instance)

This calculator will have the User do the following things. One, open a stock market chart of their choice. Second, enter numbers based on patterns from the chart.
Third, generate a recommendation to buy or sell based on a fibonacci-based formula. The user will also see a brief explanation of how the formula works.
